This repository has all the codes and reports for this project.

## 1. Installations

## 2. Project Motivation
This project aims at finding the best offer for Starbucks' customers, which is relevant to my job at workplace, so I chose it as my final project. 

## 3. Project Overview
The data provided by Udacity is simplified version of Starbucks' customers behaviors data. I first cleaned the raw data by filling null values, renaming column names, and unifying time measurement, etc., and then created several new features after EDA, and at last I tried different classification algorithms and got f1-score of 0.83.
